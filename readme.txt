This SEO plugin checks the content of posts/pages for the keyword density (single/phrases) while writing and is automatically setting the META-tags.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can optimize your Wordpress blog for search engines.
It can automatically generate meta informations (like keywords and description for example) needed for the search engine optimization (SEO) of your blog.

For detailed description of the plugin visit plugin page at[Multi Keyword Statistics](http://111waystomakemoney.com/multi-keyword-statistics/).


The multi-keyword-statistics-Plugin checks the content of a post or a page for **keyword density** (single words and optionally 2- and 3-word phrases; for each the 1-10 most commonly used can be displayed).
It can update its informations **automatically while the author is writing his content** in a variable interval (every 1-10 seconds) or manually by clicking on a button.
The script comes with english and german **stopwords**, which optionally can be filtered out before calculating the keyword densities.
Moreover the commonest keywords are extracted in a list as a **META keywords** suggestion.
Based on this list a **META description** can be created and automatically set.
So the plugin can be used to do the on-page part of your SEO strategy.

**Features:**

* **Keyword density statistics** about the usage of single keywords and keyphrases (2- and 3-words)
* Setting an individual **title** for each page and post
* **META keywords** will be set automatically based on the page content
* **META description** generated from content based on the Multi Keyword Statistics
* Definition of individual titles, keywords and descriptions for all kinds of content aggregations. A set of variables that can be used on the specific aggregations - keywords will be filled up automatically to the maximum number of keys (you can define this too) with the ones generated from the listed posts.
* Predecessors and successors that will be added to all page titles and descriptions served by your blog
* Sitewide definition of meta keywords that will appear at the end or the beginning of the keyword list on each page of your blog - in addition to the ones defined for single posts or pages and at the various aggregations keyword lists.
* Page-specific control of **robots META**
* Generation of **Canonical URLs** - also for all kinds of content aggregation (lists with last posts, archive, tag, category, search results and author including pagination)
* Controls the **index**/**follow** settings of the content aggregations (full control of robots for the specific aggregations)
* Configuration of ODP, Yahoo! Directory and ARCHIVE (archiving of the content for search engines like google but also at archive.org) META
* Prevents urls resulting in a not found response (404) from indexation
* All meta tags generated by the plugin can be switched off separately to prevent collisions with other plugins
* Using nonces for plugins security

**Stopwords filtered for:**

* Brazilian Portoguese
* Bulgarian
* Czech
* Danish
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Hungarian
* Polish
* Slovak
* Spanish
* Turkish

**Backend translations for:**

* English
* German
* Slovak

**Please notify:** The SEO-relevant meta-information (meta keywords, meta description and the robots meta-tag) will be generated - and served - only for pages and posts which are saved **after** plugin installation.
You have to open and save an older post or page if you want to generate the meta data for the particular content.
For now there is no way to do this automatically.

The administrator can allow ordinary authors to change META informations or not.
Even if changing is disallowed an author can see the keyword density and can be guided from the statistics while he is writing the content.
He can do the on-page search engine optimization incidentally by knowing which keyword density should be reached.
This makes SEO easier for authors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

For any other questions on the plugin visit plugin page at[Multi Keyword Statistics](http://111waystomakemoney.com/multi-keyword-statistics/).

= My language is not supported by the plugin! How can I replace a language I don't need with another one? =

First you should add the language specific stopwords. You can integrate them in the file stopwords.js. The simpliest way: If you are writing in french you can edit the block defined with `'de'` which you replace with `'fr'` - if you don't need the german language. After that you can replace the wordlist with the french ones. At least you have to search the file multi-keyword-statistics.php for all occurencies of the string `<option value="de"` and replace the `de` with `fr`.

= I don't know the language code for the language I want to add! Where can I find it? =

Simply have a look at http://xml.coverpages.org/iso639a.html. There you can find a list of all language codes that can be used as your content lanugage.

= I want to add my language to the existing ones! How does it work? =

Simply add the string `'*LANGUAGE*': [ *...* ],` at the second line of the file stopwords.js. Replace `*LANGUAGE*` with the one you want to integrate (`fr` if you want to integrate french for example).The `*...*` is a placeholder for the stopwords you wish to define. You must embed each word in single quotes (e.g. `'the'`). Single quotes unsed in the stopword have to be escaped with `\'`. If you wan to add `it's` you have to make it this way: `'it\'s'`. Between the stopwords you need a `,` to separate them.

At least you have to search after all occurencies of `<option value="de"`. Just copy these lines and insert them the line before. Then change all `"de"`s in the new line to `"fr"`. From now on you can set french as your default language and also choose it in edit post/page.

= Which words should appear in the stopword list? =

The stopword list should only contain single words with no double meanings. For example in the dutch language the word 'weer' means 'weather' but also 'again'. Words like that should not appear in the list. There are two reasons why: Firstly these words are helping search engines to classify the page content and these words are surely not classified as stopwords by Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The second reason is that there are some people writing about weather and they need this word to be listed as a keyword and not as a stopword. So please avoid those words if you want to filter stopwords.

= Every time the plugin has been updated I need to reintegrate my stopwords. What can I do to prevent this? =

Just send me the stopword list. Before you do this be sure that the stopwords face the conditions described above. I'll check the wordlist - if there is a way of automatic translation - and add it to the plugin. In future updates the stopwords stay inside the plugin so you don't have to do it anymore.

= I am missing some stopwords in the plugin's list. Can you add them? =

If there are some words that - for your meaning - belong to the stopword list just send them to me via. e-mail. I'll check and maybe add them to the existing.

= Where can I get the plugin with my native backend language? =

You have to create your own pot file of the plugin which is containing the localized captions. Translate the captions in the pot file and build your own mo file. The name of this file has to keep the structure condition `multi-keyword-statistics-*LANGUAGE*.mo`. *LANGUAGE* is a placeolder for your personal language - to be exact the shortcode of it. If you are translating the captions to spanish you'll use `es` instead of it.

More about localization you'll find at [I18n](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) and [Translating WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress)

= How can I translate the plugin's backend to my language? =

If you want to translate the captions displayed at the admin interface or the author's view for editing posts, you'll have to edit the included file named `multi-keyword-statistics.pot` that comes with the current version of the plugin. There you see the english captions used in the backend.

It is separated in blocks beginning with comments - recognizable at a `#` - which is followed by two lines. The first line is containing the double quoted english caption initiated by a `msgid` at the beginning of the line. At the second line - initiated by `msgstr` - you can add your translation between the double quotes.

After translating all messages you can send me the file and I'll integrate the translation. At the end your authors got rid of the language mix at their backend.
